HELP!  Tidy crapped on my html!

I hope I'm not in the wrong room or asking a question that nobody knows the answer to....DOES ANYBODY KNOW HOW TO CLEAN THIS unTIDY header tag out of my html ? I would prefer a cli script to do it recursively since I accidentally trusted the stupid untidy program under the assumption that it would simply double-check my work....instead it crapped on it and then had the audacity to inject a link in the header back to its site with a snippet of strange code I'd rather not have.

There are over 5 T H O U S A N D pages I need to remove this bad unethical injection from (in fact it's way more if you are counting the online bible I host).

This is a shame....backup, I tell my customers that all the time, backup before you mess with corporate crap...uggghhh.....dammit man.
